# X.me Dual-Token Economic Model Whitepaper

**Version: 2.1**

**Date: January 19, 2026**

## 1. Vision & Executive Summary

As a pioneer in the Web3 ecosystem, X.me is dedicated to building a community-driven content and social platform where trust is built on shared vision and exchange. We firmly believe that a robust economic model is the cornerstone of realizing this vision. This whitepaper details the dual-token (XME/XMEX) economic model designed as the core of the X.me platform. This model not only draws on the best practices of the existing Web3 ecosystem but also realizes profound thinking about the Web3 ecological business ecosystem.

We have overcome the inherent limitations of single-token models in balancing incentive mechanisms and value accumulation. By introducing a dual-token system with clear functions and complementary mechanisms, we have constructed an economic flywheel capable of simultaneously balancing the ecosystem structure and community platform value. **XME**, as the governance token, symbolizes platform ownership and is the core of value capture; **XMEX**, as the utility token, is the catalyst for incentivizing daily platform activities and the development of the content ecosystem. The synergy between the two aims to lay a solid foundation for the continuous, healthy, and sustainable development of X.me.

The core philosophy of X.me is: **Realizing Value Return and Returning Sovereignty to Users**. In the current internet ecosystem, users are creators and consumers of content, but often are merely "traffic" in the platform's business model, with the vast majority of the value they contribute being extracted by centralized platforms. The birth of X.me aims to completely overturn this unfair status quo. We are not just building the next short-video app; we are building the starting point of a decentralized content ecosystem co-created by global users.

## 2. Design Philosophy: Four Strategic Pillars

Our economic model is built upon the following four strategic pillars, ensuring the system's robustness and forward-looking nature:

### 2.1 Functional Specialization

We believe that specialization is the source of efficiency and clarity. XME focuses on macro-governance and value storage, while XMEX focuses on micro-incentives and value circulation. Each operates independently without interference, fundamentally solving the problem of confused value metrics.

### 2.2 "Faucet" Output and "Sink" Consumption

We have designed diverse "Faucets" (output) and "Sinks" (consumption) mechanisms for XMEX to ensure the self-balance of the economic cycle, effectively hedging against inflation risks. On the output side, XMEX is continuously released through multi-dimensional incentive mechanisms such as behavior mining, content creation incentives, and invitation growth. On the consumption side, XMEX is continuously consumed through diverse scenarios such as content promotion, advanced AI tools, virtual props, and creator tipping, forming a healthy production-consumption balance.

### 2.3 Centripetal Value Drive

The prosperity of the platform ecosystem must be concretely reflected in the core value. We have designed mechanisms to ensure that XMEX's economic activities continuously aggregate and precipitate into value XME, making XMEX a tool for long-term transmission and deep participation in the platform. By staking XMEX, users can obtain XME equity and dividends from ecosystem growth, forming a value upgrade path from utility token to governance token.

### 2.4 Substantive Governance

We pursue not just formal decentralization but substantive community co-governance. XME holders have direct influence over major platform decisions, from proposals to data treasury usage, covering everything. The community's voice becomes the ultimate compass for the platform's development. The platform adopts the principle of progressive decentralized governance, ensuring efficient operation in the early stages while laying the foundation for future community autonomy.

## 3. Dual-Token Architecture: A Binary Concerto of Governance and Utility

| Token | Name | Positioning | Core Functions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **XME** | X.me Governance Token | **Value & Governance Token** | Symbol of platform ownership, community governance voting, yield acquisition, equity credentials, long-term value storage |
| **XMEX** | X.me Utility Token | **Incentive & Utility Token** | Behavior mining incentives, content tipping, in-ecosystem consumption, platform service fees, medium of value circulation |

## 4. XME: The Platform's Value Anchor and Scepter of Governance

XME is the core of the X.me universe and the gravitational center of all value. It represents not only openness on the platform but also the direct link between community members and key platform decision-making rights. XME empowers holders with governance rights and long-term equity in platform development, usable for protocol governance voting, node staking, advertising settlement, and value storage.

### 4.1 Core Functions

-   **Decentralized Governance**: Community members can obtain vXME (voting power) by staking XME, directly participating in major platform decisions. The scope of governance includes but is not limited to: adjusting key economic parameters, determining content recommendation algorithms, adjusting incentive model parameters, protocol upgrades, etc.
-   **Dividend Rights & Power**: XME is a gateway to capturing platform revenue. Due to the core value and scarcity of XME, holders can receive XMEX rewards (staking rewards) and have the right to vote on "Buyback and Burn" plans, creating value for all holders through deflation.
-   **Exclusive Identity Privileges**: Staking XME is a prerequisite for obtaining top-tier identities and privileges on the platform. This includes unique "Badges", priority participation in new feature Beta testing, and opportunities for close communication with creators. These extraordinary privileges provide security for the value of XME.
-   **Commercial Value Scenarios**: Advertisers can use XME governance tokens for advertising settlement, providing enterprise-level demand scenarios for XME and supporting its long-term value.

### 4.2 How It Empowers X.me

The emergence of XME brings to X.me a core hub composed of long-term value resources of users. It regulates all related issues, collectively dedicated to enhancing platform value. Importantly, the truly decentralized governance structure driven by XME is the cornerstone for X.me to build trust and transparency in the Web3 field. Through the XME governance mechanism, users transform from passive consumers into active decision-makers and ecosystem owners.

## 5. XMEX: The Platform's Growth Engine and Economic Lifeblood

XMEX is the energy currency of the X.me ecosystem, a catalyst for promoting user growth, content creation, and community interaction. Its design core lies in "High Liquidity, Incentive-First." XMEX is the "fuel" for ecosystem operation, representing the contribution value and consumable equity of users within the platform.

### 5.1 Acquiring XMEX: Ubiquitous Incentive Network (Output)

We have built a "Behavior Control" system covering every user lifecycle, ensuring that every behavior within the platform receives positive economic feedback. This mechanism is called "Social Mining", quantifying every user behavior on X.me—viewing, liking, commenting, sharing, creating—into contribution values and rewarding them with XMEX tokens.

-   **Basic Incentives**: Completing daily check-ins, effective content browsing, and following suggested assessments are basic tasks for obtaining XMEX rewards, effectively incentivizing user activity and retention.
-   **Growth Incentive Mechanism**: By triggering the community sharing mechanism, successfully inviting users to join the X.me ecosystem rewards both the inviter and the invitee with upper-layer XMEX rewards. This is crucial for the platform to achieve viral growth.
-   **Content Incentives**: High-quality content published by creators will continuously earn XMEX rewards based on community visibility metrics (e.g., views, likes, bookmarks). This is our core means of incentivizing high-quality content creation.
-   **Interaction Incentives**: User social behaviors such as commenting, sharing, and following generate contributions, and XMEX incentives are distributed regularly based on contributions, realizing a positive correlation between user participation and earnings.

### 5.2 Consuming XMEX: Carefully Designed Value Exits (Consumption)

We have designed diverse high-frequency consumption scenarios for XMEX to ensure the health and sustainability of the economic cycle. Through the following multi-dimensional consumption scenario designs, XMEX forms a closed loop of Output—Consumption—Reflow within the ecosystem.

-   **Content Service Consumption**: Unlocking paid content, purchasing membership services, buying virtual goods, etc. These consumptions are the most basic and core consumption scenarios for XMEX.
-   **Functional Consumption**: Creators can pay XMEX to purchase traffic boosting services, content heating, hot spot recommendations, etc., to increase content exposure; users can purchase personalized digital collectibles or obtain other Web3 identities.
-   **Advanced AI Service Consumption**: Users need to hold or consume a certain amount of XMEX to use advanced creation services, such as higher-performance cloud rendering, richer model libraries, personalized AI assistants, etc.
-   **Event Participation**: The platform regularly holds various community activities, such as hot topic Q&A and business behaviors, all requiring XMEX as a participation credential.
-   **User Growth Consumption**: Users can choose to consume tokens to accelerate growth, protect levels, unlock privileges, etc.
-   **Value Ascension Channel**: We provide a liquidity mining platform for XMEX holders, who can choose to exchange it for XME. XMEX represents platform ownership. Thus completing the identity transformation from "Participant" to "Owner", this process will permanently lock XMEX and form a closed loop for the entire ecosystem.

### 5.3 Content Assetization and Value Realization

In addition to behavioral incentives, X.me also provides more value to creators through content assetization mechanisms. Content published by creators will be hashed on-chain, becoming digital assets they own. This not only solves the problem of content sovereignty but also opens up new monetization channels for creators. Your content can circulate across platforms, and your ownership of the content belongs to you forever, and will not be frozen or deleted due to platform decisions.

### 5.4 How It Empowers X.me

XMEX is a powerful growth engine, continuously injecting vitality into the platform. It is not only an operational tool for improving key metrics such as Daily Active Users (DAU) and Monthly Active Users (MAU) but also the core guarantee for attracting and retaining high-quality content creators and building a prosperous content ecosystem. Its economic data will be used as X.me's best practice to show the world its health and growth potential. Users acquire XMEX through contribution behaviors and use XMEX again for platform services and equity redemption, forming a closed loop of Output—Consumption—Reflow, ensuring that tokens are not released unidirectionally but circulate within the ecosystem.

## 6. User Growth and Incentive System

X.me has designed a complete growth incentive system for users, encouraging continuous participation and contribution. This system designs user growth as a clear, sustainable process. By completing various tasks and contribution behaviors, users will gradually improve their levels and privileges.

### 6.1 Phased Growth Path

User growth on the platform is designed as a clear, sustainable process. This design aims to:

-   Provide users with clear participation goals and a sense of achievement
-   Incentivize users for long-term investment and deep participation
-   Give corresponding rights and returns based on the user's contribution level

### 6.2 Behavior Incentive Mechanism

The platform includes users' multi-dimensional behaviors (such as viewing, interacting, creating, inviting, etc.) in the incentive scope. Different types of behaviors contribute differently to the ecosystem, so the incentives obtained will also vary. This design ensures:

-   Every beneficial behavior of users can be rewarded
-   Incentives match contribution levels, achieving fair distribution
-   The higher the user participation, the greater the potential for earnings

### 6.3 Progressive Privilege System

As users' levels increase, they will unlock more ecosystem privileges, including:

-   **Growth Privileges**: Faster upgrade speed, higher incentive multipliers, earlier unlocking of advanced tasks, etc.
-   **Incentive Privileges**: Higher daily incentive claim limits, increased reward weights for high-value tasks, etc.
-   **Distribution & Exposure Privileges**: Content publication receives fairer initial distribution weights, priority participation in platform recommendation mechanism testing, etc.

The purpose of this system is to allow high-contribution users to receive more returns while incentivizing other users to continuously improve their participation.

### 6.4 Value Consumption and Circulation

To ensure the virtuous cycle of the XMEX economic system, the platform has designed multiple token consumption and value reflow mechanisms. Through the above multi-dimensional consumption scenario designs, XMEX forms a closed loop of Output—Consumption—Reflow within the ecosystem:

-   Users acquire XMEX through contribution behaviors
-   Users use XMEX for platform services, equity redemption, content promotion, etc.
-   Fees collected by the platform and consumed XMEX are used for buyback and burn or redistribution
-   Forming a healthy production-consumption balance, ensuring continuous token circulation

## 7. XMEX Staking Mechanism and Equity System

In addition to earning income through behavior mining, you can also share the dividends of platform growth and achieve continuous asset appreciation by staking XMEX. The XMEX staking mechanism is not "locking for fixed income" in the traditional sense, but an ecosystem participation and equity acquisition mechanism.

### 7.1 Original Intention of Staking Mechanism Design

The core goals of the XMEX staking mechanism are:

-   Encourage users to participate in the X.me ecosystem for the long term, forming a stable content and social network
-   Return real platform business value to ecosystem contributors in a rule-based manner
-   Provide a sustainable incentive engine for the "Social + Earning" model
-   Build long-term trust through transparent rules rather than income promises

### 7.2 Delegated Staking Model

X.me introduces Delegated Staking, where users can delegate XMEX to "Community Nodes" within the platform to jointly participate in ecosystem construction. Users can freely choose one or more nodes for delegation, and delegation supports unbinding (a short cooling-off period can be set to balance liquidity and security). The total amount of delegation a node can receive is related to its own commitment/node level, avoiding the unlimited expansion of "irresponsible nodes".

### 7.3 Staking Yield Mechanism

The staking mechanism adopts a monthly compound interest model, and users' staking yields are closely linked to ecosystem development. Specifically:

-   **Yield Sources**: Staking yields mainly come from the reflow of platform commercial revenue, incentive pool distribution, and token appreciation brought by ecosystem growth.
-   **Compound Interest Effect**: Users' staking principal and interest will automatically be compounded and re-staked. Over time, yields will show exponential growth.
-   **Ecosystem Positive Correlation**: Your staking yield is completely positively correlated with the prosperity of the entire ecosystem (user growth, platform revenue, activity) and personal participation depth (staking duration, staking amount). The more the ecosystem develops and the more active users are, the greater your staking yield potential.

### 7.4 Core Staking Privileges

After users delegate XMEX, they are not promised fixed income but unlock three core privileges:

-   **Growth Privileges**: Obtain user level growth bonuses, level retention/demotion protection, earlier unlocking of advanced tasks, etc.
-   **Incentive Privileges**: Obtain higher daily incentive claim limits, increased reward weights for high-value tasks, etc.
-   **Distribution & Exposure Privileges**: Content publication receives fairer initial distribution weights, priority participation in platform recommendation mechanism testing, etc.

### 7.5 Sustainability of Staking

The core purpose of this mechanism design is: to provide a stable passive income channel for users who are optimistic about the X.me ecosystem for the long term, while incentivizing users to participate in and co-build the ecosystem for the long term. Staking can not only bring you considerable returns, but more importantly, you become a beneficiary of ecosystem growth, closely linked to the platform's development destiny.

## 8. Token Allocation & Release

**XME Total Supply: 1 Billion (Fixed)**

| Allocation | Percentage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Ecosystem & Treasury** | 25% |
| **Public Sale** | 25% |
| **User Incentive Airdrop** | 15% |
| **Core Team & Advisors** | 15% |
| **Private Sale** | 10% |
| **Liquidity Provision** | 10% |

**XMEX Total Supply: 100 Billion (Initial Total)**

The allocation management of XMEX mainly lies in "On-Demand Release Allocation". The vast majority (90%) will serve as ecosystem incentives, publicly distributed to participants contributing to the X.me ecosystem over the next eight years through methods such as "Behavior Control" and "Content Control" mentioned above. Allocation follows these principles:

-   Fair distribution based on user contribution levels
-   Balance between incentives and consumption to ensure economic health
-   Regularly publish XMEX output and consumption data to accept community supervision
-   Flexibly adjust incentive parameters based on ecosystem development status

## 9. Conclusion

We firmly believe that the dual-token economic model constructed by X.me is a sophisticated system integrating incentives, value closed-loops, and community co-governance. It is not just an economic architecture but an important tool for us to realize the grand vision of "building a value network truly centered on creators and users". XME defines the platform's breadth (governance rights and ownership), while XMEX defines the platform's depth (incentives and participation).

Through four innovative mechanisms: Behavior Mining, Content Assetization, AI-Empowered Creation, and Open Economic Ecosystem, X.me provides users with true value return. Users are no longer passive consumers but owners and decision-makers of the ecosystem. As the ecosystem develops, users' rights and interests will also continue to grow.

We sincerely invite all creators and users to witness and participate in this exciting socio-economic experiment with us. On X.me, every minute of yours is mining, and every interaction is increasing your earnings.
